    <p class="title">“New Beginnings”</p> 
    <p>“In the Beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.”  <a href="#">Genesis 1:1</a></p>
    <p>Everything we know and understand has a beginning.  Creation in every form, the sun, moon, and stars.  Our human beginning was Adam and Eve and everyone who has a birthday has a beginning.  We have seasons, years, months, weeks and days and even minutes. God’s plan has purpose, organization, and a perfect design.  We have holidays and celebrations to remind us of new beginnings.  What is your favorite “new beginning”?</p> 
    <p>Jesus Christ, God’s Son is the only unique human ever born.  Jesus had no beginning and was with God and the Spirit at Creation.  (<a href="#">Genesis 1:26</a>) “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.” </p>       
    <p>(<a href="#">Genesis 3:22</a>)”Then the Lord God said, Behold the man has become like one of us, knowing good from evil.”  At Jesus’ birth He was born in human flesh. He was fully man and fully God. He had no human beginning until He agreed to be born into our world, but He remained divine.</p>  
    <p>Most of us just completed celebrating Christmas, which marked the birth of Jesus, who was born to forgive mankind from sin. He taught us how to love each other and our Creator and experience a new Spiritual Birth where  in we live for eternity in a new forever home.</p>           
    <p>Think of all the beginnings we have had in our lifetime.  We have had physical birth, some of us have had a Spiritual birth, a first friendship, first day at school, first party, our first bicycle, and many more.</p>  
    <p>Jesus had many of those same firsts.  Jesus had a first day at school (<a href="#">Luke 2:46-47</a>); He had his first friendships; (<a href="#">Mark 3:13-19</a>) - 12 men call Disciples.  There was His Baptism (<a href="#">Matthew 3:16</a>) and His first Miracle (<a href="#">John 2:11</a>), which was the Wedding at Cana.  There was His first job, (<a href="#">Matthew 13:55-56</a>) - He was a carpenter. Jesus knew the purpose and the secrets of the Parables (<a href="#">Mark 4:10-11</a>), the first and only person to have power to give eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="#">John 3:35-36</a>).  His first legacy was the Christian Church, (<a href="#">Ephesians 5:23-24</a>) “For the Husband is head of the wife, as Christ is also head of the church, as He Himself being savior of the body”. Before Christ’s birth, men lived by the LAW and the promise of something better. At Christ’s resurrection, believers who made up the Church were gifted with FORGIVENESS from the sin in their lives, and the beginning of forgiveness is a lifetime of love, joy, and peace.</p>
