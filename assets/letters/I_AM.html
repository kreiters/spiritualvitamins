    <p class="title">April 2024 - I AM</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Exodus 3:14</a> I AM who I AM. Then Moses said to God, when
      they ask me who YOU are, what shall I say? And the Lord said to Moses, I
      AM.
    </p>
    <p>April 2024 letter on the I AM statements</p>
    <p>
      Who is God? Who is Jesus? I went to the Bible to answer these questions.
      In the quote from Exodus 3:14 God is declaring that He is not a new god
      but The God of creation. He is eternal, unchanging, self-existing and THE
      GOD of all. We will see that Jesus also claims the same declaration in the
      I AM series. They are one and equal in the Trinity. The verse above and
      the I AM verses of Jesus validate the claim of the Father, Son, and Holy
      Spirit, being three in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my search using the Jeremiah Study Bible. In addition to the
      scripture Dr. Jeremiah's charts and footnotes were most helpful. I also
      found an internet source titled, “Voice of Prophesy”, and a contributor
      named Jean Boomstra. Her comments were very insightful. My thanks to both
      for their much needed contribution. There are seven I AM's in the book of
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 1. <a href="#">John 6:35</a> “I AM the Bread of Life. He who comes to
      Me will never hunger. ” In Jesus’ day bread was considered to be the
      staple food source in a household. Here Jesus is saying He is the staple
      spiritual source for you and me. Is Jesus your basic spiritual staple?
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 2. <a href="#">John 8:12</a> “I AM The Light of the World.” On day one
      of creation God said, “Let there be light. He saw that the light was good,
      so He separated the light from the darkness.” Light helps us see the
      correct way to travel through life. Do you walk in the good light or do
      you stumble in darkness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 3. <a href="#">John 10:9-11</a> “I AM the Door.” What is the function
      of a door? Closed doors provides protection from danger. An open door
      beckons friendship and admits entry to those we love. Is your door open to
      Jesus' teaching and love?
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 4. <a href="#">John 10:11-14</a> “I AM the Good Shepherd.” We are like
      sheep and need a Shepherd. They follow the flock as do we. Both need
      protection. The Good Shepherd's sheep hear His calming voice. Do you obey
      His calm voice?
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 5. <a href="#">John 11:25</a> “I AM the Resurrection and the Life.”
      Life is our most valued gift. Jesus gave us the gift of His life on the
      cross. His gift is Life saving!Have you unwrapped His gift for you yet ?
      His gift was death and resurrection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 6. <a href="#">John 14:6</a> “I AM the Way, the Truth and the Life.”
      You will never get lost if you follow His way, and you can believe
      everything Jesus says because He is always truthful. The Bible, however,
      reports Satan, as the Father of Lies!
    </p>

    <p>
      Day 7. <a href="#">John 15:5</a> “I AM the True Vine.” Jesus said He is
      the true vine, Father God is the Caretaker, and believers are the
      branches. God prunes the branches to produce good fruit. God wants
      believers to produce much fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day 8. <a href="#">John 8:58</a> “ Before Abraham was born I AM” This was
      a confounding statement to the Pharisees. Jesus was claiming to be GOD
      YAHWEH. The Jews refused to see Christ's Glory so they looked for rocks
      and tried to stone Jesus. Do you understand God's majesty and give Him the
      glory due Him?
