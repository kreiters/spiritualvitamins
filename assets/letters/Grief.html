    <p class="title">September 2023 - The Goodness of Grief</p> 
    <p>"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
    <a href="#">Ephesians 4:30</a></p>
    <p>This month we will investigate the subject of Grief. The Bible defines grief or grieve as grief or sorrow.  We humans all experience grief at sometime in our lives.  It is the nature of mankind.</p>
    <p>Grief comes from many directions.  A child’s choice may grieve their parents,  death of a loved one present severe grief, parent’s activities may bring grief to their children. Poverty and war brings heavy grief to many families and populations.  Would you believe that the Bible gives accounts of Creator God, His Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit all having experiences of grief and sorrow?</p>
    <p>Our Savior however is capable of great compassion and mercy when we find ourselves in sorrow. The Holy Spirit was sent by God for the express purpose of comforting grieving believers.</p>
    <p>In <a href="#">Matthew 26:38</a> Jesus says, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death."  <a href="#">Isaiah 63:10</a> says "But they rebelled, and grieved the Holy Spirit."  And <a href="#">Genesis 6:6</a> says "And the Lord was sorry He made man on the earth and He was grieved in His heart."</p>
    <p>My hope is when you read these Grief vitamins you will be comforted from scripture and be uplifted, consoled, and encouraged.</p>
    <p>When you travel through these painful life experiences, remember that the action of prayer is our most powerful tool that will take you to the other side of grief.</p>
    <p>The Bible also speaks to the pain of grief and the lessons we can learn at the hand of God as He uses the powerful tool of grief. God loves us and wants to prepare us for our eternal life on that other side of grief.</p>
    <p>I have been asked if I believe there will be sorrow and grief in Heaven. Based on four scriptures, I do not believe we will have grief in heaven!  See <a href="#">Isaiah 25:8</a>, <a href="#">Matthew 5:4</a>, <a href="#">Revelation 7:17</a>, and <a href="#">Revelation 21:4</a>.  Read them and leave a <a href="./../../pages/support.html">comment</a> of what you think.</p>
