    <p class="title">August 2024 - GOD'S MESSAGE ABOUT HATE</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Matthew 6:24</a> "No one can be a slave to two masters; he
      will hate one and love the other; he will be loyal to one and despise the
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately on television I have noticed a commercial by Franklin Graham in
      which he says that he feels as if the whole world is aflame with hate. It
      seems to me that he is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope of Christian life for eternity rests on the truthful words of
      God's loving promise. <a href="#">Romans 6:23</a> "Sin pays its wage in
      death; but God's free gift is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our
      Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up Billy Graham's biography on my computer and I would like to
      share some of his wisdom on hate that I found. Here are six good ideas we
      can use when we are on the brink of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. People hate when they should love. <a href="#">Proverbs 17:17</a> 2.
      Quarrel when they should be friendly. <a href="#">John 15:15</a> 3. Fight
      when they should be peaceful. Romans 12:18 4. Wound when they should heal.
      <a href="#">Matthew 13:14</a> 5. Steal when they should share.
      <a href="#">Galatians 6:6</a> 6. Do wrong when they should do right.
      <a href="#">Proverbs 21:2</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it seem to you that individually we all struggle with these
      observations? And as a nation each of the 6 ideas are compounded? Billy
      Graham gave us the world's observations but now I'd like to share the
      Biblical view from God's perspective.
      <a href="#">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> "There are six things which the Lord
      hates, yes seven which are an abomination (of his soul) to Him."
    </p>
    <p>
      1. "God hates haughty eyes. "(pride) 2. "A lying tongue." (lies) 3. "And
      hands that shed innocent blood." (murder) 4. "A heart that devises wicked
      plans." (evil, trouble) 5. "Feet that run rapidly to evil." (mischief,
      evil folly ) 6. '"A false witness who utters lies. "(false word of
      untruth) 7. "And one who spreads strife among brothers."(gossip or
      slander)
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the Answer? The answer is love. The answer is Jesus and His
      surpassing great love and goodness.
      <a href="#">1 Corinthians 6:17</a> says, "But the one who joins himself to
      the LORD is one spirit with Him. <a href="#">Micah 6:8</a> "He has told
      you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do
      justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God. "Best of all,
      remember the Golden Rule. "Whatever you want others to do for you, do so
      for them!"
