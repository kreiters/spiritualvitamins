    <p>
      <a href="#">Matthew 13:10-11</a> "And the Disciples came and said to Him
      (Jesus), why do you speak to them in parables? Because it has been given
      to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has
      not been given."

      I love a good mystery - a book by Agatha Christy or an evening with
      sherlock Holmes. I enjoy watching the detective untangle clues and
      decipher the complex plots.

      Solomon and Jesus are recorded to be the wisest men to have lived. Solomon
      used proverbs which are word pictures to present a truth. Jesus used
      parables which is a story constructed to tell a previous unknown truth.
      The Parables are not understood by those who have eyes but cannot see and
      ears who cannot hear. Jesus used parables to teach about future events
      that were not given in the Old Testament about the kingdom of God. They
      were hidden from Israel and the Pharisees. The disciples and true
      believers can now fully understand these kingdom truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE SOWER: <a href="#">Matthew 13:18-23</a> The good news of
      the gospel will be rejected by most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE:
      <a href="#">Matthew 13:45-46</a> Christ gave His life to provide
      redemption for the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE MUSTARD SEED: <a href="#">Matthew 13:31-32</a> Believers
      and unbelievers will grow rapidly from a small beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE HIDDEN TREASURE: <a href="#">Matthew 13:44</a> Christ came
      to purchase (redeem) Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE DRAGNET: <a href="#">Matthew 13:47-50</a> Angels will come
      and separate the wicked from the righteous when Christ comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE WHEAT AND THE TARES(WEEDS):
      <a href="#">Matthew 13:24-30</a> People of faith and people of false faith
      will exist together between Christ's two advents.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLE OF THE 10 MINAS: <a href="#">Luke 19:11-14</a> Jesus teaches the
      disciples and the nation about stewardship and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARABLES OF CHRIST AND CHURCH: <a href="#">Ephesians 5:28</a> Christ is
      the Savior of the church. The great mystery is the husband and wife
      becoming one and the bond of Jesus and the church.
    </p>
