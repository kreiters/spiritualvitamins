    <p class="title">November 2024 - Seedtime and Harvest</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Genesis 8:22</a> "While the earth remains, Seedtime and
      Harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall
      not crease."
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn presents sounds and sights that refresh pleasant childhood
      memories. Remember fields of orange pumpkins, burning leaves and farmer'a
      roadside stands with red tomatoes and bright yellow corn on the cob? The
      fall is harvest time for the spring seed-time crop growing. America always
      has a bounty of produce which the Lord yearly provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      God's gift of seeds is truly amazing. He created each seed, when no human
      tampering is involved, to only produce the one thing the seed was created
      to grow. The kernel of corn will never grow beets. The eye of the potato
      will never grow an onion. Fortunately, if a female person swallows a
      watermelon seed it will not grow a baby or a watermelon.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if an individual plants evil, sinful, negative thoughts in their
      mind, they will harvest a sadly, sinful lifestyle. The Sovereign God has
      planned a much better seed-time harvest for those who plant a heart filled
      with positive moments of love, truth and God's words of wisdom. These
      individuals will live with joy and an eternity of heavenly pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Isaiah 55:10-11</a> shares God's promise on this subject. "For
      as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there
      without watering the earth, and making it bear and sprout, and furnishing
      seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so shall My word be which goes
      forth from My mouth; it shall not not return to Me empty, without
      accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding in the matter for
      which I sent it."
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Revelation 14:15</a> "And another angel came out of the
      temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, 'put in
      your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the
      harvest of the earth is ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is a great gardener and He deserves a continual harvest of
      thanksgiving from His creation. What kind of gardener are you?
