    <p class="title">Obedience to the Lord</p>
    <p><a href="#">1 Samuel 15:22</a> "Has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord?  Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed better than the fat of rams.”</p>
    <p>We begin this study on obedience with the Old Testament command.  The reference to burnt offerings and sacrifices is comparable to our current worship services.  The Lord is communicating that obedience to Him is better than our worship of Him.</p>
    <p>OBEDIENCE is one of the first things we teach our children when we become parents.  We tell them in a loving manner to obey but at times we need to command.  To tell a child lovingly that they may not run into the street in order not to be killed by a car is step one.  Many children may at first disobey, so we need to command firmly to teach safety.  Our children are either too young to understand the importance of the request or are defiant or obstinate. This is how our loving LORD teaches us. We see examples throughout the Bible.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Romans 5:19</a> illustrates this defiant behavior. “For as through the one man’s disobedience (Adam the first created man), the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One (Jesus, Son of God) the many will be made righteous.”  Christian’s salvation came as a result of Christ’s obedience.</p>
    <p>Did you know that even the Angels in heaven had to experience this obedience to their loving Creator? <a href="#">Psalm 103:20</a>  gives us a glimpse of Angelic behavior.  “Bless the Lord, you His Angels, mighty in strength, who perform His word, obeying the voice of His word.”  Then we read in <a href="#">Jude 6</a> that not all the Angels obeyed. Satan enticed them to pledge allegiance to him and disobey God, their creator.  “Remember the angels who did not stay within the limits of their proper authority, but abandoned their own dwelling place; God has kept them in the darkness below, bound in eternal chains for that great Day on which they will be condemned.”</p>
    <p>All children have to do is obey their parents and the road to adulthood is empty of pebbles and potholes.  Adults are required to obey God’s commands to live a long life of happiness and joy.  Christ was our perfect example.  Obedience is worth attempting!</p>
