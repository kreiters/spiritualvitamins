    <p class="title">January 2024 - Angels as Spiritual Servents</p>
    <p>
      "The Angel of the Lord who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the Lord."
      <a href="#">Genesis 48:16</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      As we begin the new year, may I open the Celestial door and with you
      observe God's heavenly messengers? These messengers are the angels that
      praise God night and day. Angels are the topic for this month and are
      mentioned in Genesis guarding the Tree of Life through Revelation at the
      final judgment <a href="#">Psalm 103:20-22</a>. Let's open the Bible and
      see what we can learn about God"s angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angels are created beings who are masculine gender according to names
      given in various verses (see <a href="#">Jude 9</a> &
      <a href="#">Matthew 12:26</a>). The Archangel, Michael, Gabriel, Satan (or
      Beelzebub) and Cherubim are a fragment of the Host of angels God created.
      Angels dwell in heaven and are summoned by God to be messengers and
      servants. They are capable of traveling between God's throne and earth.
      They are not babies nor women from what we read in the Bible. We read
      descriptions of angels in <a href="#">Revelation 4:4</a> and
      <a href="#">Ezekiel 1:5-14</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used three resources. Primary was the Bible. In addition, The Bible
      Knowledge Commentary written by James F. Walvood and Roy B. Zuck. Both men
      were Professors at Dallas Seminary. My third source was Nave's Topical
      Bible written by Orville J. Nave L.L.D.,L.D. Pastor Nave spent14 years of
      untiring study before writing his Topical Bible. Here are eight additional
      verses about angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. THE TRINITY AND ANGEL OF GOD: Read <a href="#">Genesis 2:1</a> and
      <a href="#">Revelation 22:8-9</a>. We are warned not to worship angels.
      They are servants of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A CELESTIAL SPIRIT: <a href="#">Luke 2:13-14</a>.
      <a href="#">Revelation 22:6</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. ANGEL POWER: <a href="#">2 Peter 2:4</a>.
      <a href="#">Revelation 4:11</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. ANGELS ANNOUNCE THREE BIRTHS: Samson, <a href="#">Judges 13:3</a>, John
      The Baptist, <a href="#">Matthew 1:20</a>, and JESUS,
      <a href="#">Luke 1:30</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. TO WORSHIP GOD: <a href="#">Philippians 2:9-11</a>,
      <a href="#">Revelation 19:4-6</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      6. ARE WISE, HOLY, MIGHTY, INNUMERABLE: <a href="#">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      7. SECOND COMING OF CHRIST: <a href="#">Luke 16:22</a>,
      <a href="#">Revelation 4:8</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. ANGELS AT JUDGMENT: <a href="#">Matthew 25:31</a>,
      <a href="#">Mark 8:38</a>, <a href="#">Jude 14</a> &
      <a href="#">Jude 15</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we exit the gates of heaven together we can still hear the Angels
      saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY. How shall we respond?
      <a href="#">1 Peter 1:13-16</a>. Amen
