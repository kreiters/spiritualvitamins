    <p class="title">Spring 2024 - Victory</p>
    <p>"The first way to Victory is to recognize the enemy." Corrie Ten Boom</p>
    <p>
      Dr. David Jeremiah, Pastor of Shadow Mountain Baptist Church in San Diego,
      California made an interesting statement. He wrote, "Scripture is filled
      with theological nuggets." I believe that Christ's Victory in Scripture is
      one of those least understood Biblical nuggets. The dictionary records
      "nugget" as a lump of something such as gold. This is the perfect
      application regarding CHRIST's victory with HIS death and resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man made by Creator GOD, was Adam. GOD formed him from a lump of
      dirt. Adam disappointed the LORD by choosing to sin against GOD and live
      unrighteously. GOD is sinless and perfect. HE could not condone Adam's
      sin. In GOD's love and grace, HIS only SON, JESUS, (the second Adam and
      perfect man) was sent to solve the sin and broken relationship problem.
      Sin brought death to Adam's descendants including you and me but JESUS'
      death on the cross and His resurrection brought the Victory (that lump of
      gold) and defeated sin, death, and Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the bottom line: If you do not believe that there was a man named
      JESUS, GOD'S only SON, and that HE did not die on the cross and was
      resurrected, then you are born once and will die twice, physically and
      spiritually.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe that the SON OF GOD, JESUS, did die on the cross and rose
      from the dead on the third day for your sin, then you are born twice, both
      physically as well as spiritually and will only die once physically.
    </p>
    <p>Are you ready to accept GOD's grace and forgiveness?</p>

      stand on the foundation of the cross." Watchman Nee
