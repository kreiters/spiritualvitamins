    <p class="title">September 2024 - Compassion</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">2 Corinthians 6:2,6</a> “Hear what God says: ‘I heard you in
      the hour of my favor, I helped you in the day of salvation.’ LISTEN! This
      is the hour to receive God’s favor, today is the day to be saved! By our
      purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness we have shown ourselves to be
      God’s servants.”
    </p>
    <p></p>

      Compassion is the hallmark of the Christian life. Compassionate growth is
      quickly apparent as a believer leans on the Holy Spirit for growth in the
      glorification process. After receiving Christ’s salvation gift, our goal
      is to become more like Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compassion for others is an identification of that growth. Biblical
      compassion is defined as kindness, sympathy, empathy, or goodwill toward
      others. Christians are called to set aside the actions of a person, when
      compassion is the goal, and remember that all people are God’s creation.
      He loves all His creation. Though He hates evil, Christians are called to
      a very high standard when considering people’s lives. We may observe a sin
      but judge only the sin while showing love and kindness to the person who
      is in great need of God’s love and compassion. It is easy to forget our
      sin. But we are encouraged to remember how much God loves us and Christ’s
      gift of forgiveness for our confessed sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Luke 6:32-33</a> “And if you love those who love you, what
      credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.” And if
      you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many people who need compassion and are overlooked. They are
      hurting, are ill, confused or are making decisions that take them down
      paths that have painful exits.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we refuse to follow God’s instruction on kindness and compassion
      willingly, God may orchestrate our life events so His purposed commands of
      kindness and compassion will be needed for ourselves. We may have a new
      outlook on giving and receiving.
    </p>

      There are those who can write beautiful, encouraging words. Others can
      make a phone call which makes all the difference in a difficult day. A
      plate of cookies from a warm oven even sounds loving. Best of all are
      those with hugs and shared tears that express the action of “I’ve been
      there and know how you feel.” Venture forth with your compassion gift and
      receive the blessing of the Lord with joy.
