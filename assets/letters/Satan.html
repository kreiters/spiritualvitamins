    <p>“Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.” <a href="#">Isaiah 5:20</a></p>
    <p>Who is to say what is Evil or Good?  God says what is evil and what is good!</p>
    <p>In <a href="#">Genesis 1:21</a> God pronounces that all creation is good including mankind.  Mankind was named as very good.  Following the flood when Noah’s family was saved and we arrive at <a href="#">Genesis 8:21</a> God promises  He will never destroy the earth by flood again nor curse the ground on account of man, for the intent of man’s heart is evil from his youth.</p> 
    <p>What happened?</p> 
    <p>What happened was that the devil started with Adam and Eve to corrupt man’s decision making and that seed of choices that are evil.  The Lord sees this corruption and is saddened by it.
    <p>What is the definition of evil?  The Biblical definition is something or someone who is bad, wicked, or wrong.  When a person makes a choice 
    to follow Satan (who is evil) instead of the Lord God (who is good) that leads to wicked behavior.  Read <a href="#">Psalm 73:1</a> or <a href="#">Psalm 143:10</a>. Read also <a href="#">Mark 10:18</a> 
    which is a conversation between Jesus and the rich, young ruler.  Jesus said to the young man, “Why do you call me good?  Only God is good.”
    <p>How do we overcome evil with good?
    <p>Paul gives us the answer in <a href="#">Romans 12:21</a>.  “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” Some might say, not possible. Here is a footnote comment on <a href="#">Romans 12:21</a>. Dr. David Jeremiah.  “Overcoming evil is costly.  Often it involves absorbing the pain of someone else’s wrong.  But one may gain a friend and promote a reconciliation in the process.”  Overcoming is only possible if it is done by someone with a personal attachment to the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>Closing Thoughts.  How can we be ready for Spiritual Battle?
    <p><a href="#">1 John 4:4</a>  “You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”</p>
    <p>One last quote by Dr. David Jeremiah.”Perhaps Satan’s greatest trick concerns his own identity.  He has enabled the world to think of him as a impish demon dressed in red, with a pitchfork and a pointy tail. Pictured ... as a cartoon character worthy of a laugh. Nothing could be more wrong.</p>
    <p>Instead of a red-dressed imp, Satan is a powerful being portrayed in Scripture like a “roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. (<a href="#">1 Peter 5:8</a>)
    He can destroy, divide, and discourage using that which reveals his character; lies, counterfeits, and deception.
    But for all his schemes and power, we do not need to fear him.  For the God who is in us is greater than the devil who is in the world.
    Be ready for spiritual battle by submitting to God and resisting  the devil-- and he will flee from you.  (<a href="#">James 4:7</a>)</p>
