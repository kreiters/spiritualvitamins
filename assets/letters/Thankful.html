    <p><a href="#">Psalm 100: 3-4</a></p>
    <p>Know that the LORD Himself is GOD, It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are 
        His people and the sheep of His pastures .... Give thanks to Him and bless His name, for the 
        LORD is good.</p>
        <p>America’s Thanksgiving Day has changed from our nation’s first Thanksgiving. I thought it would 
        be good for me to refresh my memory of this historic beginning of the celebration and share a 
        small memory of it with you in our November Spiritual Vitamins.</p> 
        <p>The Mayflower landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620 with just over 100 people surviving the trip 
        from Europe. There are only two written reports of the events which took place for the Pilgrims 
        durning their first year in America. Both the voyage and the winter were brutal. One account by 
        Edward Winslow dated December 1621 and another manuscript written about 20 years later by 
        William Bradford, who was the first Governor of the colony. They tell us it was a 3 day event with 
        feasting, games, and military training.</p>
        <p>According to accounts it was a celebration of survival from a cruel winter for which the Pilgrims 
        were unprepared but a good harvest. It was attended by some 50 colonist that included 22 
        men, 4 married women and 25 children and teenagers. The colonists were likely out numbered 
        two to one by their Native American guests who were in the area hunting and fishing. The 
        guests provided 5 deer for the celebration. Both the colonists and the Native Americans are 
        reported to have thanked the Lord for His provision.</p>
        <p>The food for the first Thanksgiving meal probably consisted of fruit and vegetables from the 
        community garden, such as cabbage, carrots, cucumbers, leeks, lettuce, parsnips, and 
        pumpkins. There were no potatoes nor cranberry sauce as we know it and no pumpkin pie.This 
        was due to the fact that there was no butter, wheat flour or even an oven to prepare the meals 
        that we enjoy today. Wild Turkeys were shot in the woods.</p> 
        <p>Today many Americans continue to join as a family, inviting guests to enjoy the Thanksgiving 
        meal with them. Some people go to homeless shelters and serve food to the less fortunate. We 
        live in a nation that has indeed enjoyed the bounty of provisions from a loving God. Are we as 
        grateful as the first Pilgrims who struggled in the new world under great hardship?. Some of the 
        new activities that have crept into our celebrations are: watching Football Games, anticipating 
        Black Friday Shopping, and sleeping off a much too full tummy. What would the Pilgrims think 
        of these activities? Let’s be sure to remember both our Thanks and our Giving.</p>
        <p>“But the wisdom from above is pure, first of all; it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly; it is full of 
        compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy. And 
        righteousness is the harvest that is produced from the seeds the peacemakers planted in 
        peace.” <a href="#">James 3:17-18</a></p>
