    <p>
      <a href="#">1 Peter 1:23</a> "For you have been born again, not of seed
      which is perishable, but imperishable."
    </p>
    <p>Seven Steps to Follow Faith in Christ</p>
    <p>
      The very best definition of faith is found in
      <a href="#">Hebrews 11:1</a> in the Bible. "Now faith is the substance of
      things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.‚Äù This verse teaches we
      can be sure about God, (hypostasis). Being certain (elencho), about unseen
      hopes and realities. The Bible says Faith wins Gods acceptance and reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step after Faith is Virtue. The disciple, Paul is concerned about
      the immorality in the Corinthians Church and quotes a pagan writer,
      Menander, with an ancient definition. "Bad company corrupts good
      character. My grandmother used to quote, "One rotten apple spoils the
      whole barrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge is the third topic after Faith and Virtue. Knowledge is
      understanding and related to discern. Love of Christ surpasses knowledge
      of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-Control is fourth in our walk. It is a big challenge for most of us.
      We see the lack of it daily on television. The Bible lists 19 negative
      traits of faithlessness in <a href="#">2 Timothy 3:1-9</a>. without self-
      control. <a href="#">Galatians 5:23</a> names it as fruit from the Holy
      Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth step is Perseverance. Iwo Churches in Revelation were commended
      for their steadfast perseverance. Thyatira is promised authority over the
      nations, and the Philidelphia church would be a pillar in the temple of
      God. Rewards are given by God for perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godliness, which is next step holds a great mystery. The mystery concerns
      Christ and was hidden in previous years but now revealed. Here is the
      revelation. 1. Christ appeared in body. 2. Was vindicated by the Holy
      Spirit. 3. Seen by Angels. 4. Preached among nations. 5. Believed on by
      the world. 6. Taken up in glory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our last step, number seven is Brotherly kindness and Brotherly love. We
      who are a part of the Christian faith are expected to experience God's
      Faithful Love and reproduce it in our life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We end with a snapshot of the facets of faith as we remember the scripture
      on Love. <a href="#">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>. The images of Faith, Hope
      and Love are excellent, but Love is eternal.
