    <p class="title">FEBRUARY 2021 VALENTINES ---- GOD'S LOVE</p> 
        <p>I love February because love is the emphasis for the month. The verses 
        that you will be reading will be encouraging you to express a very distinct 
        love from God.</p> 
        <p>Christian love is a selfless love and different from the world's love which 
        includes erotic love or emotional affection. God is love and is personified in 
        His Son Jesus. <a href="#">John 3:16</a> states: "For God so loved the world that He 
        gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, 
        but have everlasting life."</p> 
        <p>God's love is selfless, noble, compassionate and generous considering it 
        was given to a sinful mankind. We are to strive for this same love. 
        Because Jesus was sinless and the second person of the Trinity, He was 
        able to express this Agape Love on the cross. <a href="#">Ephesians 5:2</a> says: "And 
        walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, 
        an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."</p> 
        <p>In <a href="#">Hebrews 10:24,25</a> we read: "And let us consider how to stimulate 
        one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own 
        assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one 
        another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near."</p>
        <p>The most quoted verses by Christians on love is found in <a href="#">1 Corinthians 13</a>. 
        Beginning in Verse 4-8 "Love is patient, love is kind and it is not 
        jealous, love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act 
        unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoke, does not take 
        into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, 
        but rejoices in truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all 
        things, endures all things. Love Never Fails!"</p> 
        <p>There are 77 verses recorded in my Bible Concordance and this is only a 
        small example of how important God considers the issue of Agape Love. 
        Make February your love month too. I send this letter with love and prayers.</p>
