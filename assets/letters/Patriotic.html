    <p class="title">One Nation Under God</p>
    <p><a href="#">JAMES 1:25</a><i>“BUT ONE WHO LOOKS INTENTLY AT THE PERFECT LAW, THE LAW OF LIBERTY, AND  ABIDES BY IT, ....IS AN EFFECTUAL DOER.  THIS MAN SHALL BE BLESSED IN WHAT HE DOES.”</i></p>
    <p>This letter is about the joys of a Christian nation. A nation where God rules. It is an explanation for why a nation under God’s system is the best. The attraction of God’s plan is that it benefits all the people of a nation not just a few.</p>
    <p>TRUTH:  Truth is the cornerstone of God’s liberation by releasing honest leadership and its people from the bondage of sin and disorder.  One verse on Biblical truth is Jesus’ statement in <a href="#">John 14:6.</a>  “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”.  We would do well to remember this verse.  It leads to Liberty!</p> 
    <p>HONESTY:   Honesty follows naturally as truth advances. As freedoms develop in a God fearing nation, fears evaporate and the people trust the government leaders.  Honesty holds the important qualities of integrity, morality and incorruptibility.</p> 
    <p>JUSTICE:  Justice is given by a government when truth and honesty reign. We know that fairness and equality are two positive features that promote justice. A just nation under Christian directives is another center-point of freedom. </p> 
    <p>TAXATION:  Ten tax references are listed in my Bible from Numbers thru Luke. Jesus understood the importance of collecting and using taxes. The often read example in Jesus’ own words is in <a href="#">Luke 20:22</a>. Honesty by all parties, is the core of taxation.</p> 
    <p>OBEDIENCE:  Combining the previous four attributes results in obedience. Law and order in a government is the crux of freedom. Submission to obey and trust leaders results in obedience from the nation’s citizens.</p>
    <p>LAW AND RULE:  The very first laws were given by God. Almighty God gave us Ten Commandments. When we disobey these laws and all other laws given by our Creator, we open up our nation to corruption. In <a href="#">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a> we are taught to read these laws, meditate on them and teach them to our children. By disobeying these commands our precious gifts of freedom and liberty are eroded.  The consequence of this action for her citizens is dire.</p>
    <p>BLESSING:  Our nation has enjoyed being the recipient of much of the world’s wealth, natural resources, personal freedoms, and scientific progress. In spite of our disobedience, for 246 years God has favored our country.  If we cherish our blessings we need God’s support and an attitude change in our republic.</p> 
    <p>LIBERTY:  My conclusion is that God gives liberty and bounty to a nation who appreciates His gifts. Independence, self-will and determination are to be treasured. When we loose these God given freedoms, we will loose free-will.  Tyranny, and slavery will follow.</p>
    <p>I choose God’s freedom.  Which will you choose?</p>
