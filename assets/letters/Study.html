    <p>“For what was written in earlier times was written for our 
        instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of 
        the Scripture we might have hope.” Romans 15:4</p> 
        <p>Studying the Bible informs us about the life and purpose of Jesus and your 
        eternal life with God in Heaven. Did you know that God created you to live 
        forever? When your life is over here on earth, whether it is 50 years or 100 
        years, you will continue to exist. For those who love Christ and make Him 
        king in their life they will dwell in heaven for endless time. This is God’s 
        perfect plan for a new earth where sin will not exist and love will reign. John 
        3:15 “That whoever believes in Him (Jesus) should not perish but 
        have eternal life.”</p>
        <p>For those who do not accept Christ’s free gift before they die, their eternity 
        will be in the Lake of Fire. There they will experience endless pain and 
        suffering. Revelation 20:15 “Anyone not found written in the Book of 
        Life was cast into the Lake of Fire.”</p> 
        <p>Facts about the Scripture are: The Bible has 66 books within its cover. It 
        was written over a period of 1,500 years by more than 40 authors who were 
        inspired by the Holy Spirit. God’s message concerns the need to reconcile 
        people’s relationship with a sinless loving God. Galatians 3:26; “For you all 
        are sons of God through Christ Jesus.” Galatians 3:14 “That the 
        blessings of Abraham might come upon Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that 
        we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.”</p> 
        <p>God gave mankind the Bible as a help to learn great knowledge, gain
        wisdom, understand history, grow in love for Him as our Creator, and to 
        receive the forever peace that Jesus’s death bestowed upon us.</p> 
        <p>Studying Scripture is vital! Many famous Theologians have studied the 
        Bible in many different ways. Here are some ideas. (1) Read 1 Psalm and 1 
        Proverb daily; (2) Plan to read through the entire Bible in 1 year; (3) 
        Examine as many verses as you can of God’s promises and claim them; (4) 
        Investigate one subject such as Sin or Salvation and learn what God says 
        about it; (5) Memorize some important verses.</p> 
        <p>“Nature forms us; Sin deforms us; School informs us; and Christ 
         transforms us.” Anonymous</p>
