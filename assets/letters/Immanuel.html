    <p>“Let us thank God for His priceless gift.” <a href="#">2 Corinthians 9:5</a></p>
    <p>Immanuel= God with us. How amazing is this?  God has sent His Son to earth to live with His created beings. To love them, to die on the cross in a gruesome death for them as an aid to their salvation from death and to rise from the dead to confirm eternal life with the Father, God.  It is difficult to believe, but true, that God loves each of us individually.  He created each person to have a spirit and a physical body. He gifted each of us to communicate with Him as a special, personal touch to each life.</p> 
    <p>God through His Holy Spirit planted His divine seed into the human womb of the virgin Mary. This gift given in this way allowed His Son Jesus to be fully God and fully man.  The beautiful song of Mary to her God is recorded in <a href="#">Luke 1:46-56</a> and reveals why God chose her to give birth to His Son.</p> 
    <p>Jesus’ earthly father, Joseph was also chosen and gifted by the Lord to protect and raise His Son.  The Bible records Joseph’s assurance from God in a dream.  <a href="#">Matthew 1:20-21</a> and establishes the true facts of Joseph’s contribution to Jesus’ life.</p>
    <p>Quoting from <a href="#">Hebrews 2:18</a>; <a href="#">Hebrews 4:15</a>; and <a href="#">Hebrews 5:8</a>, Dr. Jeremiah tells us about Jesus’ identity.  “Jesus was born a King, yet chose to be born in a stable.  He had rights to royalty, yet He gave up those rights and humbled Himself.  He came from riches, yet He chose to be birthed in rags. He came from indescribable power, yet He was born into poverty.  He came in such a way that you and I might see Him as one of us-- someone who suffered and was tempted just as we are.”</p>
    <p>Immanuel= God with us.  Timothy Keller said it best.  “It’s almost too limiting to say that we “celebrate” ... Christmas.  We stare dumbstruck, lost in wonder, love and praise ... God being born into our world.“</p>
