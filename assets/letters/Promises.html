    <p>“Grace and Peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.”  “For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” <a href="#">2 Peter 1:2-4</a></p>
                                                
    <p>Here near the end of the Bible we find the book of Second Peter.  It has been described as Peter’s last will and testament to the Christians who were scattered all over the world.  Peter like Paul penned this last letter before he was martyred in Rome in AD 66.</p>
    <p>I was amazed at how similar the 7 Growth of Faith principles resemble the 9 Fruit of the Spirit qualities listed in <a href="#">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.</p> 
    <p>To become ‘partakers of the divine nature” (verse 4) believers are to live according to God’s promises in scripture. Living a life consistent with God’s plan for our maturity and His Divine Nature attain scripture’s promises.  These 7 qualities when added to our Faith with all diligence do  not earn our salvation.  We are saved by God’s grace and Christ’s sacrifice on the cross and resurrection.  Faith in this belief is the keystone of our knowledge which produces our growth to the divine nature.</p>
    <p>First in the passage is Faith. It is correctly defined in <a href="#">Hebrews 11:1</a>.  “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.”</p> 
    <p>Second we read the word Virtue.  This quality is correctly defined as moral courage. Other definitions would be purity, decency, or ethics.</p>
    <p>Third is Knowledge which is the gathering of truth.  <a href="#">Proverbs 1:7</a> reads “Reverence for the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.”</p>
    <p>Fourth in the list of qualities is Self- Control .  Self discipline, restraint, will power and composure encapsulate this very difficult quality.  It seems to take a lot of help from the Holy Spirit to attain self-control.</p>
    <p>Fifth in the line of growing qualities is Perseverance. This is a tenacity or a persistence in our reverence for God and His standard.  We observe this quality in the running of a race to win the goal.</p>
    <p>Sixth is Godliness.  Growing more like God daily.  Seeking to be like Christ in all areas of our life best describes this quality.</p>                            
    <p>Seven is Kindness which follows the perseverance.  This kindness requires a growing compassion of mercy and grace toward other believers.</p>
    <p>Last but best is Love.  Love is the final goal and is best explained in grace and mercy.  This concludes the qualities that God promises for us if we seek to live within His desire for us.  Not to grow is short-sighted of us.</p>
