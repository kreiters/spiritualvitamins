    <p class="title">December 2023 - Christmas Joy</p> 
    <p>"But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self-Control."
        <a href="#">Galatians 5:22</a></p>
        
        <p>As we approach the Christmas celebration this December none of the
        joy has lost the luster it held for me as a child. The sparkle of lights on the
        Christmas tree, holiday music, baking cookies, the manger scene in the
        front yard, candles or angels in the window all have special memories.
        I grew up in Ohio so Christmas without snow was unacceptable. On
        Christmas eve my mother would walk to the midnight Church service with
        my brother on one side of her and myself on the other side. Snow
        scrunched under our shoes with its own particular sound. Sometimes if
        we were lucky a few snowflakes would float down making me snuggle
        under my mother's arm. I felt comfy and safe and full of quiet joy.
        Christmas Eve was the only time my mother went to church. That made it
        special for me.</p>
        <p> A few weeks ago I heard a television report about a group in Michigan
        who requested that this year they wanted people to decorate in other
        colors than red and green. They also ask that people decorate with
        snowmen, snowflakes and other non religious symbols. No Baby Jesus in
        a manger, no Shepherds, no Angels! What were they thinking? No
        religious symbols? Christmas is a Christian religious, faith based holiday!
        Jesus' birth is the entire reason for Christians to spread God's great love,
        peace, and joy for a few short weeks a year. I selected JOY for the
        December vitamins because JOY is what I feel at this time of year. I know
        that there are some who do not feel JOY of Christmas. I understand that
        they may feel this way for various reasons, but I challenge anyone feeling
        this way to read the Bible and find the JOY! Here are some people who felt
        like myself.</p>
       <p>1. John the cousin of Jesus while still in the womb: <a href="#">Luke 1:44</a></p>
       <p>2. Mary the mother of Jesus in her song to the LORD: <a href="#">Luke 1:47</a></p>
       <p>3. An Angel with a host of Angels: <a href="#">Luke 2:10</a></p>
       <p>4. The Magi when the star led them to Jesus: <a href="#">Matthew 2:9-10</a></p>
       <p>5. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary at the tomb: <a href="#">Matthew 28:1-8</a></p>
       <p>6. Jesus Himself while speaking to His Disciples: <a href="#">John 15:10-11</a></p>
        <p><a href="#">Jude 24</a>: "Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
        and to make you stand in the presence of His glory with great
        joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
        be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and
        now and forever. AMEN."</p>
