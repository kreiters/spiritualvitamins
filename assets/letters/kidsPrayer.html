    <p>The Lord's Prayer</p>
    <p><a href="#">Matthew 6:9-13</a> and <a href="#">Luke 11:1-4</a></p>
    <p>“It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished one of the disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray just as John (the Baptist) taught his disciples.”</p>
    <p>Those of us who are Christians have taken this prayer, that Jesus taught His disciples as our way to talk to God, our Father. This is a example for us when we want to pray. It’s like talking to God on our phone.
        <p>As I read more about this prayer, I learned that in Israel, during the years when Jesus lived, it was common for men who were very wise to have a school for children.  Each Rabbi (the title for a teacher) would have his own little school for children and sometimes Adults. This Bible verse seems to say that John the Baptist had a school for the people who followed him. The disciples, who followed Jesus ask for a prayer also. Jesus taught His disciples to pray just as He did. Try to memorize this prayer to God.</p> 
        <p>Let’s read this prayer together.</p>
        <p>OUR FATHER,</p>
        <p>WHO IS IN HEAVEN, HOLY IS YOUR NAME.</p>
        <p>YOUR KINGDOM COME,YOUR WILL BE DONE,</p>
        <p>ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.</p>
        <p>GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD,</p>
        <p>AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS, AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS.</p>
        <p>LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION,BUT DELIVER US FROM  EVIL. AMEN.</p>
        <p>1. Our Father. Jesus wanted the disciples to call God Father just as Jesus did. God is the creator of all people.</p>     
        <p>2. Who is in Heaven. God lives in heaven. It is His home.</p>               
        <p>3. Holy is your name. God’s name is special. We should never miss use His name in a bad way. It makes God sad.</p>
        <p>4. Your kingdom come, Your will be done, On Earth as it is in Heaven. All of heaven and earth is God’s kingdom. We ask that God rule all of it. God is a good Ruler or King.</p>
        <p>5. Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. Some people pray using the words forgive our Trespasses.  Both mean the same. Doing something bad to another person is called a Debt or Trespass. We ask God to forgive us for doing bad things. If we forgive He forgives us.</p> 
        <p>6. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. SATAN or the DEVIL is the evil one who is against God and Christians.</p>
        <p>We must pray and ask God to protect us from Satan and evil actions.</p>
