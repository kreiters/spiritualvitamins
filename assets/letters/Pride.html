    <p class="title">March 2023 - Understanding Pride</p> 
    <p>"EVERYONE WHO EXALTS HIMSELF WILL BE HUMBLED, BUT HE
        WHO HUMBLES HIMSELF WILL BE EXALTED." <a href="#">Luke 18:14</a></p>
    <p>Pride is the subject for March. I knew I had pride in my husband, in my
        children, in my life with Christ, but when I read the definition of pride in the
        Bible I knew I had to reconsider. "Pride is the universal human sin" says Dr.
        Jeremiah and he concludes,"Pride is the stench of sin and it is worse than all
        the foul odors on earth. Only the Bible tells us how to rid our life of the foul
        effects of sin." Sin brings unhappiness in this life and death in Hell in our
        forever life. The only escape from this death-bearing sin is Salvation through
        Jesus Christ and His gift of forgiveness.</p>
    <p>The dictionary records prideful people as arrogant or conceited. This is the
        opposite of humility. Dr. Jeffress calls pride "Very simply, an attitude that causes
        us to credit ourselves for our successes and blame others for our failures." He
        continues, "Humility is an attitude that views both our accomplishments and our
        failures from God's perspective."</p>
    <p>The earliest biblical record of pride is Genesis 3 where Satan (also named
        Lucifer), appears before Adam and Eve and tempts them to believe they are
        wiser and entitled to more privileges than God granted them. <a href="#">1 John 2:16-17</a>
        lists 3 examples of temptation and identifies the common ingredient as pride:</p>
    <p>1. Lust of the Flesh: physical temptations; 2. Lust of the eyes: greed, envy and
        extravagance; 3. Pride of Life: arrogant desire to be recognized or to make others
        jealous, including wealth or importance.</p>
    <p>I have compiled a short list of Bible personalities that may help us to focus on
        how we may avoid the sin of pride and acquire humility.</p>
    <p>1. <a href="#">Genesis 3:5</a> Satan, a fallen Angel from Heaven says. "God knows that the
        day you eat the fruit your eyes will be opened and you will be like God."</p>
    <p>2. <a href="#">Daniel 4:28-37</a> A King of a powerful country speaks. Nebuchadnezzar, the
        King of Babylon reflected in verse 28 that Babylon is great and he is the
        king who accomplish this great royal life. In verse 37 after God had dealt
        severely with him he says this: "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise, exalt and
        honor the King of Heaven..." He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</p>
    <p>3. <a href="#">Mark 7:22</a> Jesus says "Out of the heart of men proceeds evil thoughts.
        There are 13 evil traits mentioned. Pride and foolishness are the last two.</p>
    <p>4. <a href="#">1 Peter 5:8-9</a> Satan is still the real adversary. By resisting Satan by the
        power of the Holy Spirit we can bury pride and attain humility.</p>
