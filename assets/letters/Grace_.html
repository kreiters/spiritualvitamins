    <p class="title">October 2024 - God's Grace</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Genesis 6:5-8</a> "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of
      man was great in the earth. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD."
    </p>
    <p>
      The biblical definition of grace is the unearned, undeserved favor of the
      LORD toward those who have faith in Him. Jonathan Hayashi posted an
      acronym on the internet that you may have heard before. "Grace is God's
      Righteousness At Christ's Expense." In other words, a free gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      How we treat this unconditional gift is important. We live and grow both
      now and in eternity. Our growth depends on diligent study and deepening
      knowledge about Jesus. The Christian life is not stagnate grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the opening scripture we read that Noah alone received God's grace and
      the rest of humanity perished. The Lord observed this wickedness and
      grieved greatly. Noah was not sinless. What did Noah do to receive this
      grace? The answer is--Nothing! He did nothing just as we do nothing. It is
      God's free gift, given to whom He pleases to give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the New Testament book of James chapter 4 verses 6-12 we are given a
      list of commands that will help us walk a deeper walk in grace and
      humility. "But He (God) gives more grace. Therefore He says: 'God resists
      the proud, but gives grace to the humble.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a short list of commands for those who have received grace and
      want to mature in fellowship with the LORD.
    </p>
    <p>1. Submit your life to the one true God.</p>
    <p>2. Refuse to embrace Satan's enticements.</p>
    <p>3. Lament over your past sins.</p>
    <p>4. Make your life experiences full of worship.</p>
    <p>5. Work to let humility be your standard.</p>
    <p>6. Resist judging friends and neighbors and live in fellowship.</p>
    <p>7. Pride causes boasting. And boasting is wrong.</p>

    <p>
      Verse 17 says, "If a person knows what is right and good but does not do
      it, that person is guilty of sin."
