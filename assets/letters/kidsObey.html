    <p class="title">Children Obey the Lord</p>
    <p><a href="#">Ephesians 6:1</a> "Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.  Honor your father and your mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that you may live long on the earth.”</p>
    <p>This is a very important command from God to all children.  The promise is that when you obey your mother and father, who love you very much, you will be kept as safe a possible by what they tell you to do and what not to do.  Obedience by you will result in a long, safe, fun life.</p>
    <p>The Lord does not tell you this important advice only one time!  Listen to the other two commands by God that are in the Bible. <a href="#">Proverbs 6:20</a>  “My son, observe the commandment of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.” <a href="#">Proverbs 23:22</a> “Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.”</p>
    <p>To obey your parents, or your grandparents, or your teacher is an action word.  It means to do something, to submit to their authority until you are old enough to make good adult decisions yourself.</p>
    <p>Remember, to be commanded is not a suggestion.  God’s commands do not say, “Obey if you want to.  Obey if you feel like it”.  God says that He is smarter than we are and if He commands us to do something it is because He and our Parents love us so much.  Adults know best because they have lived longer and have had to experience some difficult things when they didn’t obey God.  They want to keep you from getting hurt.</p>
    <p>Try an special experiment for 3 days.  Obey everything your mother and father ask you to do.  Obey them right when they ask you.  See if you don’t feel better at the end of each day.  Check out if you feel more loved as their son or daughter.  Notice if they look surprised at how obedient you are!</p>
