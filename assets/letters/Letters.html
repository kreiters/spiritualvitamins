    <p><a href="#">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>  “Know therefore that the Lord your God; He is God, the faithful 
        God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to the 1000th generation 
        with those who love Him and keep His commandments.”</p>
        <p>What a beautiful promise by our Lord! Can you begin to understand the possible 
        benefit God’s promise would give to a Christian’s family who received His love to 
        the thousandth generation? In the Old Testament the word hesed, holds the idea 
        of loyalty born out of love and kindness. We see the word lovingkindness used 
        to express hesed love in the <a href="#">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> promise. God’s love is called 
        agape love in the New Testament Greek and holds the idea of selfless love or 
        divine love, God’s treasured possession.</p>
        <p>Modern Love comes in so many colors and flavors. It is really hard to distinguish 
        what kind of love we are talking about. We understand love to embrace the 
        definition of friendship, romantic love, brotherly love or even just a preference for 
        something.</p> 
        <p>Adam and Eve were loved by God but they introduced sin into the world by 
        disobeying God and behaving in depraved disobedience. This was passed on to 
        humans born to future generations. Jesus arrived in God’s timing and “loved us 
        to death”. He defeated sin by His loving sacrificial death on the cross. We read
        in <a href="#">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> Love is greater than anything else. Love is the essence of 
        God and He has birthed that great gift in us the moment we become His child. 
        It’s a mystery and a gift all wrapped up in the salvation experience.</p> 
        <p><a href="#">Romans 5:8</a> reads “But God demonstrates His own love toward us that while we 
        were yet sinners Christ died for us.” WOW! <a href="#">Ephesians 3:3</a> tells us “that by 
        revelation there was made known to me (Paul) the mystery, as I wrote before in 
        brief. (This mystery was not something mysterious but was something revealed 
        through Paul.) The mystery was not new. Gentiles were mentioned in the Old 
        Testament as being saved but now due to God’s great love both Jews and 
        Gentiles will be blessed. We will be equal heirs in the one body of Christ’s love.</p>
        <p>God’s blessing is so profound. You do not have to remain a sinner, cut off from 
        God’s love. Pray and ask the Creator God to forgive you for your sin. Ask Jesus 
        to be King of your life and ask Jesus to reflect His Love in you.
        <p>I will end with advice from the half brother of Jesus. <a href="#">Jude 21</a> “Keep yourself in 
        the love of God, waiting anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to 
        eternal life.” Allow love to be your hallmark.</p>
