    <p class="title">Easter 2024 - The Resurrection</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Job 19:25</a> "I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last
      He will take His stand on the earth."
    </p>

      Suppose you witness a serious traffic accident. Being helpful you approach
      each vehicle to check on the driver's condition. A 9l1 call on your cell
      phone brings ambulance help. The Police arrive seeking an eyewitness to
      the accident among the crowd. When they find you the proof and evidence of
      the accident is truthfully reported by you. It is important to the police
      when receiving testimony about an event to seek an honest eyewitness.

      I can see a similar likeness between eyewitness reports on a modern
      accident and the eyewitness reports on Christ's death and resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven Hundred years before Jesus' birth the Bible predicts the events in
      <a href="#">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> and <a href="#">Psalm 22:17-18</a>. The
      Apostle Paul wrote about the death and resurrection truth in
      <a href="#">1 Corinthians 15:3-8</a>. "I passed on to you what I have
      received, which is of the greatest importance; that Christ died for our
      sins, as written in the scriptures; that He was buried and raised to life
      on the third day; that He appeared to Peter, and then to all twelve
      apostles." At the time of Paul's writing only 15-20 years had passed from
      Christ's death. Paul's accuracy was never questioned by the more than 500
      eyewitnesses who were still living at that time, although some had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is the death and resurrection of Jesus important? The Bible clearly
      tells us in scripture that Adam and Eve disobeyed their Creator God and
      brought sin into the world. They were created for eternal fellowship with
      God, never to experience death. Because of the sin of disobedience, death
      entered the world. Paul once again wrote about a secret that had not been
      previously understood. <a href="#">I Corinthians 15:50-57</a> "Listen to
      this secret: we shall not all die, but in an instant we shall all be
      changed. In the blink of an eye and the sound of the trumpet those who
      have given their sins to Jesus and asked for forgiveness (Christ
      believers) will be forgiven for their sin and will dwell in Heaven with
      immortal bodies. Death will be destroyed and our Victory will be complete.
      Satan brought sin and death into the world and those who do not believe in
      Jesus will be cast into the lake of fire in Hell.
