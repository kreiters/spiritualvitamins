    <p><a href="#">Revelation 1:3</a> - "Blessed (Happy) is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heeds the things that are written in it for the time is near."</p>
        <p>As the family of Noah left the ark we learn the names of his three sons. They were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. In <a href="#">Genesis 9:20</a> we learn that Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. He drank too much wine and passed out. During this event his son, Ham, sinned and was cursed while Shem and Japheth remained righteous. Sin again entered the world and the sons went to live in different areas of the land.</p>
        <p>Now you would think that the sons had seen God's miracles and been taught by a righteous father about respecting God giving them a desire to worship God and not sin against Him. But sin grew in the hearts of the sons progeny and sin was once more a problem on the earth.</p>
        
        <p>Sin has shown its ugly head down through the many generations, and God had this to say through the Apostle Paul in Scripture (<a href="#">Romans 3:23</a>): "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Since God cannot look at sin, this prevented anyone going to heaven, the abode of God, following their death. <a href="#">Romans 6:23</a> says "For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. "The Bible gives us a lot of information about the place called heaven, which is the desirable home for believing Christians.</p>
        <p>Have you decided where you want to spend eternity? You must make this decision before you die. This is the Creator's plan for us to follow. God provided for us by paying the price for our sin by sending His only Son Jesus Christ. Read <a href="#">John 3:16</a>. Jesus is waiting for righteous, forgiven sinners, to come home to Him.</p>
        <p>Our Heavenly Home is filled with Joy and Happiness. In <a href="#">Revelation 21</a> the Apostle John was sent a vision by God and is told about the future. Heaven will be a brand new Holy City. Our God will be there with Jesus, and we won't need sun or moon because God will be our light. There will be no more sin, only love, no more tears, only happiness, no more night only light. Jesus is preparing a home just for us and the gates to the city will be like pearls and we will never fear for the gates will never be closed.</p>
        <p>It takes faith in Jesus to reach this beautiful city and God even helps us have all the information to make the happy choice. <a href="#">Ephesians 2:4</a> "But God being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive with Christ, by grace you have been saved and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</p> 
        <p>My prayer is that when the time comes you will be Happy in Heaven with me.</p>
