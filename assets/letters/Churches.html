    <p class="title">The Seven Churches Overcome letter - May 2024</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Revelation 1:5-6</a> "To Him who loved us and washed us from
      our sins in His own blood, and has made us Kings and Priests to His God
      and Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Revelation was written by the disciple John, who was a prisoner on the
      Isle of Patmos, to the 7 churches located in Asia. The 7 Spirits before
      the throne is the Holy Spirit. The mystery of the 7 stars seen by John is
      revealed as the 7 Angels of the 7 churches who hold the lampstands. The
      lampstands are not the light, but hold the light of God and His
      instructions to pass on to future believers. John then writes down the
      names of the 7 churches who hold the light, and the messages for us.

      My thanks for the information, footnotes and charts used from the Jeremiah
      Bible, as well as help and enlighten from the Bible Knowledge Commentary
      by Dr. John F. Walvoord and Dr. Roy B. Zuck. "He who has an ear, let him
      hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
