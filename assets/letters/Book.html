    <p class="title">February 2023 - The Bible: God’s Book of Love Letters</p> 
    <p>“And now these three remain: FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE. But the greatest of these is LOVE.” (<a href="#">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>)</p>
    <p>(My prayer) “Lord, fill my mind with Your law and scripture.  Fill my heart with Your love and obedience.”</p>
    <p>I love February and Valentine’s Day as well as Easter and Christmas. These holidays all have God’s love in common!  I use Valentine’s Day to observe the Biblical Law “Love your neighbor as yourself” and the Law to “Obey all God’s commandments.”  Easter presents God Incarnate. A love so great He died on the cross for Believers in Him.  Christmas reveals God’s love in a gift named Immanuel (God with us). Jesus performed miracles and created teaching situations which revealed His love for mankind and His Precepts and Commandments.</p>
    <p>This February I’ve chosen <a href="#">Psalm 19:7-10</a> and <a href="#">Psalm 119:160</a> as Vitamins to teach us how to be ALMIGHTY LOVING. Quoting C.S. Lewis: “Though our feelings come and go, (God’s) love for us does not.”</p>

        <p>Day 5 The Fear of the Lord (awe, dread, reverence) is Clean (wash, purified) enduring Forever (eternal).</p>
        <p>Day 6: Judgment (condemnation) is True (real, reliable) Righteous (virtuous).</p>
        <p>Day 7: Sum (total) God’s Word (message, speech) is Truth (genuine, honest).</p>
