    <p class="title">Wisdom From Above</p>
    <p><a href="#">Proverbs 2:6,7</a>  For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth comes knowledge and understanding.  He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity.”</p>
    <p>WHY HAVE WISDOM?  The above verse establishes the truth of Biblical Wisdom. Christians believe that God is the giver of all good gifts.  Wisdom is certainly a wonderful and useful gift from our loving God and we should be very thankful for His shield of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS WISDOM?  After reading Scripture I think Wisdom is a combination of Knowledge and Truth. Without knowledge (and the leading word in knowledge is the word know), we are unable to discern problems and situations correctly.  Truth is the twin to knowledge.  Without truth we lack a foundation for decision-making.  Without truth we are blind and helpless.  God has given us these basic and important tools to live worthy lives in service to Him.</p>
    <p>WHO WANTS WISDOM? Just about everyone wants wisdom, but how many of us are willing to work for it? How many of us seek God’s wisdom? Christians only need to ask for knowledge and wisdom and the Holy Spirit will generously give it.  We know that the evil world misuses knowledge and wisdom for power and domination.</p>
    <p>WHERE CAN WE LOOK FOR WISDOM?  Two of the wisest men to have ever lived on the earth were Solomon, who is credited for having written most of the Proverbs, and Jesus Christ, who was living wisdom.  Look to Scripture for wisdom written by them.  We can trust the Holy Scripture, the Holy Spirit and the Holy God for guidance. Don’t look to the world, Satan, or television.  They all will lead you down a dark empty path.</p>
    <p>I END WITH PAUL’S PROFOUND STATEMENT OF WISDOM. <a href="#">Romans 11:33</a> “Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.  How unsearchable are His judgements and unfathomable His Ways!</p>
    <p>HOW IS YOUR WISDOM DOING TODAY?</p>
