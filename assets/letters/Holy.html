    <p class="title">April 2023 - The Holiness of the Lord</p> 
    <p>"HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. And one (angel) called out
        to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts,
        the whole earth is full of His glory."
        <a href="#">Isaiah 6:3</a></p>
    <p>In 1969 at age 31 While living in Tucson, Arizona I accepted Jesus as
        my savior. My family and I joined a small church near our home named
        Evangelical Covet Church. It was small but welcomed us with warm
        hospitality.</p>
    <p>A small choir of about 8-10 people were loyal and were robed
        for duty every Sunday. When Tim and I joined the choir it expanded to a
        full dozen. The morning service always opened with the Hymn,
        "The LORD is in His Holy Temple" as we processed down the center aisle and
        the congregation prepared their hearts to silently join in the second
        stanza, "Let all the earth keep silence before Him"
        thereby showing their love and respect for the worship of the LORD.
        </p>
    <p>Those memories have remained with me for over 50 years and caused
        me to seek to share some of my ideas on God's Holiness this month.
        </p>
    <p>The definition of Holy is Sanctified, dedicated or Sacred. From Exodus
        in the Old Testament to the books of Romans and 1 Peter in the New
        Testament God has chosen to enlighten us on His Holiness and to tell us
        what else is Holy, namely: </p>
    <p>1. The Trinity is Holy. Father, Son and Holy
        Spirit. (read <a href="#">Acts 3:14</a>) From Genesis to Exodus and in Moses' Song in
        <a href="#">Habakkuk 1:12</a> the Lord gives us proof. 
        </p>
    <p>2. God's Name is Holy. (read
        <a href="#">Psalm 145:21</a> and <a href="#">Luke 1:49</a>) 
        </p>
    <p>3. The Sabbath Day is Holy. (see <a href="#">Genesis
        2:3</a> and <a href="#">Exodus 20:8</a>)
        </p>
    <p>4. The Name of the Lord is Holy. (read <a href="#">2 Timothy
        1:9</a> and <a href="#">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) 
        </p>
    <p>5. Believers who are devoted to God and are dedicated to
        the work of God are called Saints. (read <a href="#">Romans 12:1</a>)
        </p>
    <p>What did I learn about our Holy God from these verses? God is sacred
        and worthy of our love and worship because of His Holiness! All He has
        created is provided in His holiness for believers. Faith in the "Holy One" is
        our key to living a holy life. Holiness is much to be desired!
        </p>
    <p>Psalm 11:4 The Lord is in His holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven.</p>
    <p>Note: On day 3 of the accompanying vitamins, I quote Cyprian, who lived
        from 210 to 258. He was the Bishop of Carthage and an early church
        writer.
