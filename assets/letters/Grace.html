    <p>God's Gift of Grace</p>
    <p><a href="#">John 1:14</a>"And the WORD became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."</p>
    <p>How much do you understand about God’s gift of GRACE?  I knew very little about grace. The Greek word for grace is charin which means benevolence or undeserved favor.</p> 
    <p>A closer study of Grace reveals a deeper understanding.  Grace can first be found in <a href="#">Genesis 6:8</a>.  Scripture reports God found favor with Noah.  The Hebrew word favor translates as the giving of grace.  More profound is the information that The birth of Jesus was the gift of grace. <a href="#">Titus 2:11</a> ”For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men.”</p>
        <p>In <a href="#">Ephesians 3:1,8</a> Paul says he is a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of the Gentiles. This gift of grace was given to him for the purpose of preaching to the Gentiles. GRACE is the PERSON OF JESUS. A gift to Believers for SALVATION.</p>
            <p><a href="#">Ephesians 2:8</a> tells us “For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourself, it is the gift of God.</p>  
                <p>Sadly, not all people receive this wonderful gift of grace. The grace of God is love freely shown toward guilty sinners.  However, unless man admits he is a sinner he doesn’t receive this wonderful gift of grace.</p>
                    <p>J.J. Packer is a professor of historical and systematic theology at Regent College in Vancouver.  He says, “Understanding Grace can be challenging at best, difficult definitely.”  His book, Knowing God, in chapter 13 on The Grace of God educated me a little and I would like to share a small portion with you.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 crucial truths in the understanding of Grace.</p>
                            <p>MORAL ILLNESS IN MAN.  Modern man’s heart is pagan.  Man imagines God as a magnified image of himself.  He believes there are no sinners and turns a blind eye to all wrong doings by himself and mankind.  Romans 3:23.</p>
                                <p>THE RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE OF GOD.  Man believes that as long as evil can be ignored it should be.  And he believes God feels as he does. However, God is judge of all the earth. He created it and us!  Read <a href="#">Psalm 100</a> and <a href="#">Genesis 1</a></p>
                                    <p>THE SPIRITUAL IMPOTENCE OF MAN.  Mankind is not perfect--we are helpless. Modern man subscribes to the belief that we can repair our own relationship with God by putting God in the position where He can’t say NO! However, to mend man’s relationship, having once lost it, is beyond our power.  Christians must understand this before we can share biblical faith in God’s grace.  Read <a href="#">Romans 5: 6-10</a> Man is helpless, God is love, and Jesus saves.</p>
                                        <p>THE SOVEREIGN FREEDOM OF GOD.  Modern pagans feel God is somehow obliged to love and help us. Even if we know we don’t deserve it.  This feeling was voiced by a French “free thinker” who died saying, “God will forgive---that is His job.”  However, God does not depend on His human creation for His well being.  Scripture disputes this theory. <a href="#">Psalm 50:8-13</a> and <a href="#">Acts 17:25</a>.  A Christian must believe his Judge has become his Savior. Grace and Salvation are bound together.  (Cause and Effect) <a href="#">Ephesians 2:4,5</a>.</p>
