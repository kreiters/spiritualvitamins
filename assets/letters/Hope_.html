    <p class="title">June 2024 - Hope</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Proverbs 23:17-18</a> "Do not let your heart envy sinners; but
      be zealous for the fear of the LORD all day long; for surely there is a
      hereafter, and your Hope will not be cut off."
    </p>
    <p>HOPE VITAMIN LETTER</p>
    <p>
      Hope is an interesting word. It is a short four letter word with a huge
      potential for life now and for the future. However, Christian hope is a
      gift from Jesus and His redemption. He is the reason for hope and is the
      one who restores hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worldly hope is based on wishful thinking and it is only available until
      our physical life ends. Christian hope has its foundation in the person of
      Jesus who died for our sins and gave us a promise for the future of
      eternal life in heaven.
    </p>

      Scripture has a lot to say about hope. It is defined as comfort,
      expectation, confidence and trust. We are to direct our life in these
      areas if we seek all that God has planned for us. Psalms has good
      instructions on the subject of our forever hope.

      "My soul, wait silently for God alone; for my expectation is from Him."
      <a href="#">Psalm 62:5</a>. "We delight our Lord when we fear and love
      Him, who hope in His mercy." <a href="#">Psalm 147:11</a>. "" You are my
      hope O Lord God; You are my trust from my youth."
      <a href="#">Psalm 71:5</a>.
    </p>

      The man, JOB, is one of my most admired people in the Bible. In spite of
      illness, pain, death of all his children and loss of all his wealth, Job
      was totally committed to the Lord. Here are his words in
      <a href="#">Job 13:15</a>. "Though HE (God) slay me, I will hope in HIM."
      And again in <a href="#">Job 27:8</a>, "For what is the hope of the
      godless when he is cut off, when God requires his life?" The answer is, no
      hope! If we do not choose to hope in Christ in this earthly life, where
      the result of that decision is eternal life in heaven, then we have no
      choice after death. The very worst circumstances for you and me is to
      loose all hope. This leads to spiritual death and eternity in Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      May God bless you as you seek to live in the hope and love of the Almighty
      in this life and the next. I always find good research in the Jeremiah
      Bible and The Bible Knowledge Commentary. Once again I have used both for
      my comments and I say, Thanks, once again.
