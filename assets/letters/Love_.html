    <p class="title">February 2024 - Love</p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> "You shall love the LORD your GOD with all
      your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of February is often used to put love in the spotlight. It is
      Heart Health month, Baby Cupid with a bow and arrow is used to promote
      romantic love, and Cherrios uses heart shaped little O's to sell their
      product. There is nothing wrong for the world to use these symbols to
      target love, but it misses Cupid's target and is very shallow compared to
      the richness of GOD's love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mention of Valentine centers around two different Catholic Popes
      who attempted to promote love and marriage under the name St. Valentine in
      the Third century. They were beheaded on February 14, 496 by the Roman
      Emperor Claudius II. Love suffered a set back.
    </p>
    <p>
      God's love is Agape love. It is used over 500 times in Scripture and has a
      much deeper meaning than romantic love or superficial head knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is love? Beginning in <a href="#">1 Corinthians 13</a> verse 4
      we find Paul's Biblical definition of love. "Love is patient, love is
      kind, and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not
      act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take
      into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but
      rejoices with truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all
      things, endures all things. Love never fails."
    </p>
    <p>
      God's love is shared by Christians and is the product of a regenerate
      nature. Christians know God, not just with head knowledge but with deeper
      understanding that God is love, which He shares with us as we confess
      Jesus as Lord. We understand Jesus Christ's birth, death and resurrection
      as being the love gift to God's created beings as payment for our sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is the evidence of an unloving person? An unloving person is
      revealed by the fact that the person does not love God or His Son. This is
      a rejection of God's free gift of His Son Jesus and bears the penalty of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who does scripture command to love? Christians are commanded to love their
      neighbors as we love ourselves; husbands love your wives; pastors love
      their congregations, and we must even love our enemies. In
      <a href="#">1 John 4:21</a> we read "And this commandment we have from
      Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also."
    </p>
    <p>
      What does the disciple Peter say in <a href="#">1 Peter 4:8</a> that sums
      up the entire love responsibility? "Above all, keep fervent in your love
      for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins." This is such an
      important command that Paul says in
      <a href="#">1 Corinthians 16:22</a> "If any one does not love the Lord,
      let him be accursed." Accursed is a very strong word meaning being
      separated from Christ and missing the forever life in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>May you find greater love in the month of February.</p>
