    <p class="title">Thanksgiving Letter 2023</p> 
    <p><a href="#">Psalm 26:7</a> "I will wash my hands in innocence; so I will go about your altar,
        O Lord. that I may proclaim with a voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all Your
        wondrous works."
        </p>
        
 <p>I recently read a quote which consists of 5 words that describe the
essence of thanksgiving.
"God's giving deserves our thanksgiving!"</p>
 <p>To develop this biblical attitude of gratitude takes purpose and
concentration for most of us. We are not born with gratitude. We are born
selfish! "Feed me, I'm hungry." "Change me, I'm wet" "That's my toy". "Do
it my way."
"I need a new outfit." It takes a desire to be grateful continually
for all of the blessings God lavishes on us. You may say, "So far what
you've written is not new to me"</p>
 <p>Why do I need to change? If I could change what do I need to do to
accomplish an attitude of gratitude? These are the questions on my mind.
To begin, I believe change does not happen over night for me. I believe
gratitude happens like the drip, drip, drip of a melting icicle! It is the slow
and gradual accomplishment of reaching the much desired goal.</p>
 <p>1.
I believe all of us have room to change. God has blessed each of us so
bountifully. The writer of <a href="#">Psalm 57:7</a> expresses it as God's steadfast
love for us. We should have a steadfast goal to seek gratitude. "My
heart is steadfast, O God; my heart is steadfast, I will sing praises."</p>
<p>2.
We are always urged to pray for needs. We may ask the Holy Spirit to
make us attuned to our selfishness, our unthinking attitudes and
adverse thoughts that keep us from reaching our thankful goal.</p>
<p>3.
I hope that as you read the Spiritual Vitamins the month you will agree
that the result of working diligently toward a thankful heart and
expressing it continually develops a happy heart!</p>
<p><a href="#">Psalm 100:4</a> "Enter
His gates with Thanksgiving, and into His courts with Praise."</p>
