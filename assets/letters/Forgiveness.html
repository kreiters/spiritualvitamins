    <p>“Forgiveness is to be set loose from sin.”</p> 
    <p>The above is a quote by G. Campbell Morgan and states a perfect 
       definition of the process of making our thoughts, actions or resentments 
       pardoned with God and our fellowman. Absolution from our sin toward 
       God or others is very necessary for our fellowship and well being. The 
       channel for this process is forgiveness. Matthew 7:12 “Therefore 
       whatever you want others to do for you, do so for them, for this is the 
       Law and the Prophets.”</p> 
       <p>To understand forgiveness we must believe Romans 5:12 “Sin came 
       into the world through one man (Adam), and his sin brought death 
       with it.” Romans 5:8 continues the process “But God has shown us how 
       much He loves us: while we were still sinners Christ died or us!
       His shed blood on the cross provided for the forgiveness that we enjoy.</p> 
       <p>This plan provides that God is first of all, the unconditional forgiver 
       of the sin we allow to enter our lives. However, the Lord generously 
       forgives our sin when we sincerely ask Him to pardon us. There is no 
       limit except one to God’s forgiveness and He promises to forget once we 
       have been forgiven. The exception is Matthew 12:31 “For this reason I 
       tell you: men can be forgiven any sin and any evil thing they say; but 
       whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.”</p>
       <p>We must also understand that we are required to forgive our fellow 
       men when they sin against us. This concept is much more difficult for 
       us. We desire forgiveness from God and indeed feel grateful for it, but 
       we feel that justice demands punishment without forgiveness for those 
       who hurt or abuse us.</p>
       <p>Jesus spoke to this question in Luke 17:3,4 “If your brother sins, 
       rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven 
       times in one day, and each time he comes to you saying, ‘I repent’, you 
       must forgive him.” We must forgive as many times as forgiving is 
       needed without conditions. If we fail to forgive we are disobeying God’s 
       command. Then we become the sinner. Our sin then causes a break in 
       our fellowship with God and separates us from God’s forgiveness.</p>
       <p>Where is our THANKFULNESS for this wonderful gift of 
       Forgiveness? Psalm 92:1,5 “It is good to give Thanks to the LORD.
       How great are your works, O LORD. Your thoughts are very deep.”</p>
