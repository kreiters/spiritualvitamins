        <p>You can pray this prayer right now:</p>
        
        <p>“Dear God,
        
        I know I’m a sinner, and I ask for your forgiveness.
        I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe that He died
        for my sin and that you raised Him to life.
        I want to trust Him as my Savior and follow Him as Lord,
        from this day forward. Guide my life and help me to do your will.
        
        I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.”</p>
