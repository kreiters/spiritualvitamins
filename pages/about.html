    <p>HOW THE SPIRITUAL VITAMINS DEVELOPED</p>
        <p>While reading my Devotions one morning about 2 years 
       ago I heard a voice (yes, it was audible for me) say, “Get my 
       Word out!” I understood it to be God speaking to me. It was 
       not a dream as I was wide awake. I answered and said, “Lord, 
       I am a nobody. I am not a preacher nor do I teach women or 
       children in church. How can I get Your Word out?”</p> <p>Looking 
       back on the event that was a pretty stupid thing to say. Did I 
       think God didn’t know who He was talking to? He repeated, 
       “Get my Word out”. Later I told my husband, Tim, about the 
       encounter and we discussed possibilities. After prayer we 
       decided to produce a form of what we call “Spiritual Vitamins”.</p> 
       <p>The original vitamins were made of construction paper shaped 
       like a capsule. They contained a Title, Date and Scripture 
       verse, all hand lettered, and colored . I mailed 20 copies to 
       my adult Kreiter family and it took me 30 days to create 20 
       vitamins. They were not fancy at all.</p>
        <p>Months later Tim offered the idea that he could print the 
       vitamins on cardstock on the computer, in color and even find 
       computer art work for the front. I added an additional Quote 
       on the back side. This continued until recently when our son, 
       Kerry, offered to design a Kreiter Family web page to include 
       all past, present and future vitamins.</p> 
       <p>Now the amazing thing is that Kerry does not work with 
       computers or the design of web pages. But after several months 
       of research, and teaching himself, Kerry has created “Stage 
       three” of the Spiritual Vitamins development. On February 
       10th we are launching the Spiritual Vitamin web page and if you are 
       inclined to use it we hope that it is a blessing to you.</p>
